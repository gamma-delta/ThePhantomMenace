# The Phantom Menace

Helps you deal wth the menace that is the Phantom mob.

Getting the Speed potion effect, or eating a Glow Berry, will reset your sleep timer as if you had slept in a bed.

**Modpack Makers:** you can customize which potion effects/items reset the timer! A config entry controls the potions,
and the `thephantommenace:phantom_banisher` tag controls which used items reset the timer.
